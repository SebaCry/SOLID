# SOLID Principles: A Guide to Clean and Maintainable Code  

## Overview  
This repository is dedicated to understanding and implementing the **SOLID principles**, which are key guidelines for writing clean, maintainable, and scalable object-oriented code. Each principle addresses specific challenges in software development, aiming to improve flexibility and reduce the risk of code-breaking changes.

## What are the SOLID Principles?  
The SOLID principles are five design guidelines introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) to ensure robust software design:  

1. **S** - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)  
   - A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.  
   - **Goal**: Simplify debugging and testing by focusing each class on a single functionality.  

2. **O** - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)  
   - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.  
   - **Goal**: Add new features without altering existing code to reduce the risk of introducing bugs.  

3. **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)  
   - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.  
   - **Goal**: Ensure that derived classes extend functionality without breaking the behavior of the parent class.  

4. **I** - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)  
   - A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it doesn’t use.  
   - **Goal**: Avoid bloated interfaces by creating specific ones tailored to client needs.  

5. **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)  
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.  
   - **Goal**: Decouple components to make them more reusable and easier to modify.
